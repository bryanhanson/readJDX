Changes in version 0.3.372 2019-09-16
     + Debug options are now more consistent, documentation improved, and a new debug level was added.
     + Checking of first and last x and y values was relaxed a bit, and made more sensible.  Documentation was improved.
     + Fixed a bug in which DUP codes longer than a single character (e.g. "S2") returned the wrong answer.
     + Internal handling of mode/fmt was simplified and consistently named.
     + Argument lineNos was eliminated from most functions by naming the lists passed in.
     + decompressJDXxyy renamed decompressXYY.
     + Fixed an issue with extractParams where NMR imaginary data could be missed, based on a nuance of Bruker formatting.
     + Fixed a bug in which the y value check, required by the standard, was carried out if *any* DIF codes were present in a given line of the input file.  In fact, the check should be carried out *only if the last value on the line* was a DIF code.  Reported with careful documentation and a test file by Daniel Jacob, in Github Issue #6.  A big thank you to Daniel!
     + In the course of testing the file supplied by Daniel Jacob, discovered that a DIF code followed by a SQZ code was not handled at all (e.g. MH111).  Fixed this too.
     + Reading 2D NMR formats is still a work in progress.

Changes in version 0.3.250 2018-10--15
     + Checked against R devel r75432 which is R 3.5.1 patched.
     + README.md updated.
     + Checked against testbank.
     + ORCID added to DESCRIPTION.
     + Minor update to the vignette.

Changes in version 0.3.248 2018-08-24
     + Checked against R devel r75161 which is R 3.5.1 patched.

Changes in version 0.3.247 2018-06-30
     + Rebuilt how duplicates are handled, so that S2, which is a valid DUP string = 12, is handled correctly.

Changes in version 0.3.215 2017-01-24
     + Improvements to vignette and documentation.
     + Improvements to the debugging output options.

Changes in version 0.3.194 2017-01-23
     + Return structure now includes the comment only lines found outside of the metadata.
     + Much more robust handling of comments.
     + All test files seem to work.
     + Still a lot of polishing needed.

Changes in version 0.3.103 2017-01-13
     + Return structure now includes a data guide giving the lines where each piece of the file was parsed (improves error reporting, but needs further tweaking).
     + Will now read 2D NMR spectra in NTUPLES format (at least in the only case I have available right now).
     + Updated vignette to pinp style.  

Changes in version 0.2.1 2016-12-21
     + Fixed issue #3, problem with x values not having the correct absolute value.  Reported by Rustam.
     + Added checks for FIRSTX, LASTX.
     + Added PCRF.JDX, SBO.JDX and SBO.JDX to inst/extdata for example purposes.
     + Internal tolerance checking was made more precise.
     + Switched to using separate x and y tolerances internally.

Changes in version 0.1.32 2016-10-21
     + findDataTable renamed to findDataTables to better reflect what it does.
     + Added an argument SOFC with default TRUE.  SOFC = stop on failed check.  As currently implemented, it skips the FIRSTY check.  Suggested by Rustam as some JCAMP writers do not put FIRSTY into the file.
     + Many additions to the decompression code based on additional testing, which uncovered some previously unseen issues.  There are still some files that won't process; these will require time to troubleshoot.

Changes in version 0.1.0 2016-08-19
     + First draft of package.  Works on a wide variety of example files.
     + First release to GitHub.
