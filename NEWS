Changes in version 0.2.1 2016-12-21
     + Fixed issue #3, problem with x values not having the correct absolute value.  Reported by Rustam.
     + Added checks for FIRSTX, LASTX.
     + Added PCRF.JDX, SBO.JDX and SBO.JDX to inst/extdata for example purposes.
     + Internal tolerance checking was made more precise.
     + Switched to using separate x and y tolerances internally.

Changes in version 0.1.32 2016-10-21
     + findDataTable renamed to findDataTables to better reflect what it does.
     + Added an argument SOFC with default TRUE.  SOFC = stop on failed check.  As currently implemented, it skips the FIRSTY check.  Suggested by Rustam as some JCAMP writers do not put FIRSTY into the file.
     + Many additions to the decompression code based on additional testing, which uncovered some previously unseen issues.  There are still some files that won't process; these will require time to troubleshoot.

Changes in version 0.1.0 2016-08-19
     + First draft of package.  Works on a wide variety of example files.
     + First release to GitHub.
