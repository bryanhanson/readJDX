\description{
This is a simple utility function to direct the output of of stdout and stderr
to a file.  stdout is the information normally printed in the console, for instance
the results of \code{print(rnorm(5))}.  stderr is the output created by functions
\code{message}, \code{warning} and \code{stop}.  The purpose of this function is to allow
one to direct all this output into a single file where the results can be studied, for
instance, for troubleshooting purposes.

\dontrun{
tf <- tempfile(pattern = "SinkDemo", fileext = "txt")
sinkall(tf)
print("Hello")
print(rnorm(2))
print(normr(2)) # typo, so it errors
message("A message from message()")
warning("A warning from warning()")
cat("Information via cat\\n")
sinkall()
file.show(tf)
